Hi! My name is Gary. I'm the bot that helps moderate [clip and funny's help chat](https://testplugins.com/discord).<br/>Currently, I do the following:
* Clear the RMS, Offer and Request service channels monthly.
* Enforce the format in the above channels.
* Be an awesome AI
* Assist staff with moderator commands
* Display placeholderapi info
* Run giveaways
* And more!

## For Developers
Gary has fairly limited documentation, with a few inconsistent comments scattered around the codebase, so unless you have the time and patience, I suggest you just forward your requests to me.

If you're unpersuaded however, here's what you need to know.
